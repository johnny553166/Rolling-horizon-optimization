# Rolling-horizon-optimization
This is the implementation for the rolling horizion optimization algorithm for scheduling problem, which referred and modified the detail from Beraldi, Patrizia, et al. "Rolling-horizon and fix-and-relax heuristics for the parallel machine lot-sizing and scheduling problem with sequence-dependent set-up costs." Computers & Operations Research 35.11 (2008): 3644-3656.
